Learn Web Development Basics – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Explained for Beginners

HTML helps you structure your page into elements such as paragraphs, sections, headings, navigation bars, and so on.  

To illustrate what a page looks like, let's create a basic HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a first level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into red color</h1>
  <h2>This is a second level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into blue color</h2>
  <h3>This is a third level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into green color</h3>
  <p>This is a <em>paragragh</em> As you can see, I placed an empahisis on the word "paragraph". Now, I will change also
    the background color of the word "paragraph" to black, and its text color  to green, all with just CSS.</p>
  <p>The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
       <li>Show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
       <li>Show you how to program a web document with JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Next, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result, all with JavaScript<p/>
    <p>First number:<span id= "firstNum">2</span> <br></p>
    <p>Second number: <span id= "secondNum">7</span> </p>
    <p>Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is: <span id= "answer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
    <input type="button" id="sumButton" value="Click to add!">
</body>
</html>

Level 1 heading h1
Level 2 heading h2
Level 3 heading h3
A paragraph  p
An unordered list with bullet points  ul li
A button input input
And the whole body of the page body

CSS

While HTML is a markup language used to format/structure a web page, CSS is a design language that you use to make your web page look nice and presentable.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and you use it to improve the appearance of a web page. By adding thoughtful CSS styles, you make your page more attractive and pleasant for the end user to view and use.

What is JavaScript?
Now, if HTML is the markup language and CSS is the design language, then JavaScript is the programming language.

If you don’t know what programming is, think of certain actions you take in your daily life:

When you sense danger, you run. When you are hungry, you eat. When you are tired, you sleep. When you are cold, you look for warmth. When crossing a busy road, you calculate the distance of vehicles away from you.

Your brain has been programmed to react in a certain way or do certain things whenever something happens. In this same way, you can program your web page or individual elements to react a certain way and to do something when something else (an event) happens.

You can program actions, conditions, calculations, network requests, concurrent tasks and many other kinds of instructions.

You can access any elements through the Document Object Model API (DOM) and make them change however you want them to.

The DOM is a tree-like representation of the web page that gets loaded into the browser.
